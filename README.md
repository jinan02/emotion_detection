# Emotion-Detection

In this project, I worked on realtime emotion detection. I used the <a href='https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/msambare/fer2013' target="blank"> FER-2013 dataset from Kaggle </a> that consists of 48*48 pixel grayscale images of faces each labeled with one of seven possible emotions: angry, disgust, fear, happy, neutral, sad, and surprise.
